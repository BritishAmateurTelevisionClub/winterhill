WinterHill-3v20
===============

The main application, .sh files, driver, PIC programmer and PIC hex should all be version 3v20
Some will report as 3v20a
Do not mix versions


PCB Mods for older boards
=========================

Boards without programming jumpers near the PICs are OK 

Boards with 2 pin programming jumpers near the PICs are OK 

Boards with 3 pin programming jumpers near the PICs need to be modified for the new PIC programming method

	Remove R31, R33, R37 (and R40 if fitted)

	On PIC_A:
		connect a wire between the most northerly pin of the programming jumper and pin 26 on the PIC
		connect a 10k between this wire and pin 1 on the PIC

	On PIC_B:
		connect a wire between the most northerly pin of the programming jumper and pin 26 on the PIC
		connect a 10k between this wire and pin 1 on the PIC
		connect a 1k8 between this wire and pin 28 on the PIC


PIC Programmer			
==============

whpicprog-3v20 has the following features over 2v22:

	Both PICs are programmed in one pass without the need for jumpers or user intervention
	Board versions with jumpers may need to be modified

	There is an 8 bit status value in the bottom byte of the return value:

		If the value is >= 240 (0xf0) it is an error code and there is no PIC status included

		255		unknown error
		254		program was not run as sudo
		253		parameter error
		252		/dev/i2c-1 could not be found
		251		IO mapping error
		250		supplied hex file name could not be found
		249		hex file address out of implemented range
		248		supplied file is not a hex file

		If the return value is < 240, it contains PIC_A_STATUS (bits 3:0) and PIC_B_STATUS (bits 7:4)

		0		PIC is present but unprogrammed or version unknown (whpic-2v22 will return this)
		1		PIC is not present
		2-14	PIC software version relative to 3v00
				2 = 3v20, 3=3v30, 9=3v90, 10=4v00, 14=4v40
		15		invalid


	Usage: 		sudo ./whpicprog-3v20 HEXFILENAME		

				both PICs are programmed without any jumpers or user intervention needed
				the results are in the return value

	Usage:		sudo ./whpicprog-3v20 --check

				PICs are checked without being programmed
				the results are in the return value

				
	In the PIC-3v20 folder, there are programs for development testing which will erase just one PIC at a time
	These should be removed in the release

		sudo ./whpiceraseA-3v20
		sudo ./whpiceraseB-3v20


Main Application
================

There is an optional winterhill.ini file, which should be in the /home/pi/winterhill folder
This sets various parameters and can send commands to receivers at startup
See the included .ini file for info


Log File
========

The main application writes to a log file: /home/pi/winterhill/whlog.txt
This contains mostly startup info and receive command errors


Port Usage
==========

This has been changed to more easily allow multiple WinterHills

Baseport +

	1		sends extended LM status info for all receivers		used by whpcviewer
	2		sends 4 line info display							"
	3		sends copy of 1
	4		sends copy of 2

	20		listens for extended commands
	21-24	listens for standard MiniTioune receive commands

	41-44	sends TS

	61-64	sends LM status info
